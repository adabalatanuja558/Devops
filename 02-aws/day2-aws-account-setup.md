👉 [https://signin.aws.amazon.com/](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/)

1. Choose **Root User** login.  
2. Enter your **registered email ID** and **password**.  
3. Access the **AWS Management Console Dashboard**.

---

## 🧭 **AWS Console Overview**
| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Search Bar** | Quickly locate any AWS service (e.g., EC2, S3, IAM). |
| **Services Menu** | Grouped view of all AWS categories. |
| **Account Dropdown** | Manage billing, security, and profile. |
| **Region Selector** | Choose data center location (e.g., Asia Pacific – Mumbai). |
| **Recently Visited Services** | Quick access to frequently used tools. |

---

## 🌍 **AWS Global Infrastructure**
AWS operates in **31 Regions**, each containing multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Region** | Physical area with multiple data centers | `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) |
| **Availability Zone (AZ)** | Individual data center within a region | `ap-south-1a`, `ap-south-1b` |
| **Edge Location** | Caching location for faster delivery | Used by CloudFront CDN |

🧩 *Analogy:*  
Regions are like **cities**, AZs are **neighborhoods**, and Edge Locations are **local delivery points**.

---

## 🔐 **Account Security Setup**
Once your account is live:
1. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for the Root User.  
2. Create a new **IAM User** (Administrator Access).  
3. Log in using your **IAM User** instead of Root for daily use.  
4. Monitor costs under **Billing Dashboard**.

✅ *Following these steps protects your account and prevents unexpected charges.*

---

## 🧠 **Key Takeaways**
- You need a **valid card and verified contact info** to open an AWS account.  
- Always select **Basic (Free)** support plan.  
- AWS account activation may take up to 24 hours.  
- Use **IAM users** for operations, not your Root account.  
- The AWS console is your central hub for all services.

---

## 🧩 **Practice Task**
1. Create your **AWS Free Tier account** (Personal type).  
2. Enable **MFA** for Root user.  
3. Create one **IAM User** with Administrator Access.  
4. Log in and explore:
   - EC2  
   - S3
